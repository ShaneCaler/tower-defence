This prototype was made by following along with this Unity C# course: https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse2/

HOW TO PLAY: 
Using a mouse, place a maximum of four towers around the level to stop the enemy helldogs from reaching your base.

Upon completing this prototype, I've learned how to:

Manipulate the editor through code to allow for snap-positioning of GameObjects
- Implement basic breadth-first path-finding using a variety of C# paradigms like coroutines, lists and queues
- Configure particles to act as projectiles and allow for damage to be done and received
- Add colliders and other components to GameObjects at run-time
- Use a "Factory" GameObject to act as a spawner that is ran by coroutines
- Implement basic AI that determines the closest target to the tower and fires on it
- Work with visual and audio effects and how to trigger them in code
- Create a basic UI that tracks the number of remaining enemies, how many the player has destroyed, and the player's base health.
